###    Kiwix Offline Wiki Server    ###
###          for Zipit Z2           ###

The kiwix-serve program runs a web
server and database that parses OpenZim
files. OpenZim files typically contain
wikipedia.org information dumps. This
allows for reading wikipedia without 
and active internet connection.

The server is started by a shell script
then runs the links browser where you
can browse or search for articles to
read. 

Wiki dumps can be downloaded in various
languages from:

http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content_in_all_languages

Edit the shell script at /usr/bin/kiwix
to point the library path to your
preferred wiki dump.

         ** Important Note **
         
Limited RAM on the Zipit can cause the
kiwix-serve program to fail decompressing
newer wikipedia dumps (dumps pre 2014).
A swapfile is created during package
installation in /usr/share/kiwix
