OpenWrt package feed for Zipit Z2 - http://github.com/mozzwald/openwrt-zipit-packages

How to add this feed to your OpenWrt buildroot:

1. Clone the git repo somewhere on your system (eg $HOME/zipit/build)
	cd $HOME/zipit/build
	git clone git://github.com/mozzwald/openwrt-zipit-packages.git openwrt-zipit-packages

2. Add the feed to your OpenWrt buildroot
	cd $HOME/zipit/build/openwrt-buildroot
	echo "src-link zipit_packages $HOME/zipit/build/openwrt-zipit-packages" >> feeds.conf

3. Update the feeds in OpenWrt
	make package/symlinks V=99

Now you can use make menuconfig to add the new packages to your OpenWrt build. You can pull any
new changes from github by entering the feed directory and running 'git pull', then from your 
OpenWrt directory run 'make package/symlinks V=99'
