# Binary Package Feed

Nightly builds from this package feed can be found at

To add the binary repository to an existing OpenWRT for ZipIt install,
add this line to /etc/opkg.conf on your zipit:

src/gz snapshots http://chainxor.org/openwrt-zipit/snapshot/packages/

... then run 'opkg update'

1. Clone the packages git repo also
	git clone git://github.com/mozzwald/openwrt-zipit-packages.git openwrt-zipit-packages

2. Add the feed to your OpenWrt buildroot
	cd $HOME/zipit/build/openwrt-zipit
	echo "src-link zipit_packages $HOME/zipit/build/openwrt-zipit-packages" >> feeds.conf
