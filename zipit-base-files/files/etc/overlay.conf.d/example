### overlayfs configuration example (SD Card) ###
### ALL options are REQUIRED ###
# Files in /etc/overlay.conf.d are read from the
# jffs partition during boot. conf files should
# be numbered in the order you wish them to be
# mounted, lowest number mounted first. The last
# overlay mounted becomes the upper writable dir.
# Numbers below 10 need the preceding 0 to be
# mounted in proper order.
# ex:
#	01-mmcblk0p1.conf (mounted first)
#	10-sda1.conf	  (mounted second)
#	99-mmcblk0p2.conf (mounted last, writable)
#
# If a file name "disabled" exists in overlay.conf.d
# then only the jffs will be mounted as overlay

# Overlay device (default mmblk0p1, do not add
# preceding /dev path)
#overlaydev=mmcblk0p1

# Overlay filesystem type (default, ext2)
#fstype=ext2

# Overlay upper directory (default, upper)
# This is the directory of files on the overlaydev 
# that are overlayed onto root as r/w. Cannot be
# the device root (ie, /); must be a dir on the
# device
#upperdir=upper

# Overlay work directory (default, work)
# This is a directory on the overlaydev used by 
# the overlayfs filesystem driver. Cannot be a
# subdir of upperdir
#workdir=work
